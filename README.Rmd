Calculate the biomass of trees that have died in recent drought/insect mortality in California management units.

This is a spinoff of github.com/WoodResourcesGroup/EPIC_AllPowerLabs/tree/master/Biomass

## System requirements

1. You must have a PC, not Mac
2. You must have R installed
3. You must have 15 free GB on your hard drive 
4. You must have a shapefile of the boundary of the land unit you're interested in.

## Steps to calculating biomass loss on any management unit

1.  Go to <https://github.com/carmentubbesing/drought_tree_carbon> (this page) and download the entire github repository by clicking the big green button and selecting "Download ZIP". The newly downloaded folder will be called `drought_tree_carbon-master`. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer and place the entire unzipped `drought_tree_carbon-master` directory into it. 

2.  Download the files below from <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B81g0LRLmd0fVXlfZDFfS2VQRDg> and place them in the same folder as the github repository. Since  these files are large, it's best if you download them individually rather than trying "DOWNLOAD ALL".
    1.  LEMMA.gri (7.8 GB)
    2.  LEMMA.grd (35 MB)
    3.  drought.Rdata (30 MB)
    4.  drought16.Rdata (15 MB)

-   Note: It will take several minutes or longer to download these files from Google Drive, as they are large.
-   Note: Make sure these files are in the same folder as `drought_tree_carbon-master` but are *not* **within** `drought_tree_carbon-master`. 
    - For example, if you created a directory called `biomass_calculations` such that your file structure is `biomass_calculations/drought_tree_carbon-master`, the data files from Google Drive should be in `biomass_calculations`, so you have `biomass_calculations/LEMMA.gri`, `biomass_calculations/LEMMA.grd`, etc.

4.  Obtain a shapefile of the boundary of the land area you're interested in. The shapefile can have any coordinate reference system. Place a folder containing your shapefile into the directory `drought_tree_carbon-master/data/active_unit`.
    -   Note: The folder containing the shapefile and shapefile itself can be called whatever you want, but be sure there are no extra files in `drought_tree_carbon-master/data/active_unit`. If you run these calculations for multiple shapefiles, you will need to clear the `active_unit` folder between each calculation.

5.  Open the R file `code/GET_RESULTS.R`. 

6.  Make sure your working directory is set to `drought_tree_carbon-master/code`.

7.  Run all lines of code in `GET_RESULTS.R` and wait a few minutes (up to an hour for large shapefiles).

8.  Your results will appear as a table in a .csv file in the Results folder.
