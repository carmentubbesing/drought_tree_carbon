# drought_tree_carbon
Calculate the biomass of trees that have died in recent drought/insect mortality in California management units.

This is a spinoff of WoodResourcesGroup/EPIC_AllPowerLabs/tree/master/Biomass

## Steps to calculating biomass loss on any management unit
1. Place a folder with the shapefile into the directory `data/active_unit`. The folder and shapefile can be called whatever you want but be sure there are no extra files in the folder.
2. Open the R file `code/GET_RESULTS.R`
3. Hit run and wait a few minutes
4. Your results will appear in a .csv file in the Results folder
